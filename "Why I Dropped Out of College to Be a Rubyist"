"Why I Dropped Out of College to Be a Rubyist"

On January 31st I turned 21. On February 1st I was offered a spot in the Hungry Academy. A week later, I left one of the top 20 schools in America to become a Rubyist. The CS educational system is broken, but programs like Hungry Academy are changing the way we educate developers. Here are some of the topics I'll touch on:

* Developing in teams - what GPA failed to instill
* Test Driven Development and the Segmentation Fault (a love story)
* Code wins arguments - building products over dictating theory

I had more practical understanding of the design, development environment, and testing of Ruby applicaitons after one month in the Hungry Academy than graduating CS majors. Our industry is only as strong as the community behind it, and its future is in our hands.
