Currently training with LivingSocial's engineering team in the Hungry Academy (http://hungryacademy.com). Left school to build awesome products that change the way people interact with technology. I also aspire to give back to the community via open-source projects, with an aim at making developer's lives better.

Rock climber, music changed my life, aspiring beer snob.
